            Our Lady Virgin Most Prudent Curia, Fatima Jos, is currently led by
            a team of four officers. Brother Emmanuel Duru serves as the Curia
            President, having been appointed in 2018. He also holds multiple
            leadership positions within the organization: Head Corresponding
            Secretary for Jos Regia, Corresponding Secretary for the Bauchi
            Committee, Regia Assistant Secretary, and Vice President of Our Lady
            of Perpetual Help. <br />
            Brother Francis Anene's Legion of Mary journey began in 2007.
            Currently, he serves as the Secretary of the Virgin Most Amiable
            presidium. Additionally, he was elected Curia Vice President in
            December 2020 and continues to serve in this capacity, having been
            re-elected for a second term.
            <br />
            Brother Cornelius Ogochukwu Okonkwo, a dedicated member of the
            Legion of Mary since 2005, currently wears multiple hats within the
            organization. He serves as the secretary of Our Lady Virgin Most
            Prudent Curia Fatima, having been elected to this position on
            November 28th, 2021. Additionally, he demonstrates his leadership by
            holding the presidency of Our Lady Most Admirable Praesidium,
            appointed on May 23rd, 2021. Notably, his commitment extends
            further, as he previously served as the vice-president of the same
            Praesidium for two terms. To the glory of God, Brother Cornelius
            also contributes as the Chairperson of the Devotion Committee of the
            Legion of Mary in Fatima.<br />
            Sister Francisca Nwokocha also contributes significantly, currently
            serving her first term as the Curia Treasurer.
            <br />
            The Curia further bolstered its leadership by appointing Brother
            Vitus as the Chairperson of the Marriage Committee. Additionally,
            they entrusted Brothers Amadi Franklin and Chikezie Simon, a
            formidable team, to moderate and handle the patrician meetings
            within the parish.
