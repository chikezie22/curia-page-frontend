            Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy; hail, our life, our sweetness and
            our hope. To you we cry, poor banished children of Eve, to you we
            send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.
            Turn then, O most gracious advocate, your eyes of mercy towards us,
            and after this our exile, show us the blessed fruit of your womb,
            Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.

            has purchased for us the rewards of eternal salvation; grant, we
            beseech You, that meditating upon these mysteries in the most holy
            Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain,
            and obtain what they promise. Through the same Christ our Lord.

            fullness of faith in You and trust in her, to which it is given to
            conquer the world. Grant us a lively faith, animated by charity,

            pure love of You, and ever to see You and serve You in our
            neighbour; a faith, firm and immovable as a rock, through which we
            shall rest tranquil and steadfast amid the crosses, toils and
            disappointments of life; a courageous faith which will inspire us to
            undertake and carry out without hesitation great things for your
            glory and for the salvation of souls; a faith which will be our
            Legion’s Pillar of Fire - to lead us forth united - to kindle
            everywhere the fires of divine love - to enlighten those who are in
            darkness and in the shadow of death - to inflame those who are
            lukewarm - to bring back life to those who are dead in sin; and
            which will guide our own feet in the way of peace; so that - the
            battle of life over - our Legion may reassemble, without the loss of
            any one, in the kingdom of Your love and glory. Amen.
